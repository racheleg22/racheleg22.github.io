                    <h2>Education and Career Objectives</h2>
                    <div class="about-content">Hi, I'm Rachel!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I am completing my Masters of Science in Biomedical Engineering at Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science at Northwestern University. My interest in data science guided my coursework at Northwestern. I concentrated in data and software allowing me to gain experience and knowledge in biomedical applications of machine learning and data engineering. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I currently work as a Research Engineer at the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, a research center within the Rush University Medical Center. I work within the Devices Team to ensure proper collection and processing of data from wearable devices for mobility research. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I am fascinated by the power of data science to extract information from complex data forms to uncover information with significant implications in health and engineering. I am further interested in the applications of machine learning and integrated technology such as virtual reality and its applications in accessible health care. I am excited to continue to learn in this evolving field through experience and challenges.

                    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                    <h3>Meet Josie. . .</h3>
                    <div class="about-content">
                        Josie is my 3 year old Husky mix that I adopted after graduating college in 2020. She is a very sweet girl with a lot of energy and a little bit of sass!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In my free time I take Josie to walk and play in various parks in the Chicago area. Chicago has an abundance of beautiful public parks! Some of our favorite places are Lincoln Park and Montrose Dog Beach. Josie loves swimming in the lake, so we go to the beach as often as possible when the Chicago weather allows it.

                    <h3>Climbing</h3>
                    <div class="about-content">
                        I started bouldering this year and immdeiately loved it! Climbing is fun and constatnly offers new challenges, both physically and mentally. It is also comes with a friendly and encouraging community.
