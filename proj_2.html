                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <div class="about-content">
                        Step count is commonly used by consumers as a method of activity tracking day to day. Many wrist worn devices, including the popular Apple Watch offer step counts for the user. For this project we collected a small sample of data to explore methods for step counting and attempt to recreate the Apple Watch's step count algorithm.  
                    </div>
                    <h2>Methods</h2>
                    <div class="about-content">
                        The Apple Watch was placed on three users and several trials were recorded while the participant carried out seven different activities for 15 second intervals.

                       <br>
                       <b>Recorded Activities</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Walking</li>
                            <li>Walking while pushing (a chair on wheels)</li>
                            <li>Jogging</li>
                            <li>Running</li>
                            <li>Stairs - one step at a time </li>
                            <li>Stairs - two steps at a time </li>
                            <li>Typing</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        The data collected from Apple Watch contains many important variables. Activities relevant to step count are periodic movements such as; running, walking, or climbing stairs. This information can be used to develop a step count algorithm based on identifying each step as a cycle in the function. Each cycle will contain a local maximum indicating a step. This could be translated by counting the number of peaks and therefore steps in each trial.

                        <br>
                        The raw data from the accelerometer in the Apple Watch contained acceleration in the X, Y and Z directions separately. The euclidean norm was calculated for each time stamp to represent the magnitude of acceleration. The magnitude of acceleration versus time is shown below. 
                        
                        It is important to note that there are other local maximas that do not indicate steps, and may contribute to errors when step counting if they are too similar in magnitude to the largest peak in each cycle.

                        A low pass butterworth filter was then used to filter out noise. Peaks were counted on the filtered signal. The threshold for a peak to be counted as a step was defined as the mean of the filtered acceleration signal. Further a distance threshold was defined to prevent peaks being counted in too close of proximity. This algorithm was then applied to each trial and the results were analyzed.
                    </div>
                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <div class="about-content">
                        The algorithm varied in performance across activities. The percent error was calculated and provided in table one. The percent error was the lowest for walking and walking while pushing. The largest errors were for typing at 117% and two stair steps with 51.111%. These errors primarily arise from the threshold used from which used the mean value of magnitude to determine a cutoff for a local maxima within a cycle. If this threshold is too low, or not applicable to the activity there will be false positives such as with typing and doing the stairs. If this threshold is too high there would be false negatives. One way to combat this would be to amplify the points of interest, which is not done by our algorithm. For activities such as typing that are misinterpreted as steps, an additional filter would be needed to distinguish activities. Using additional parameters such as the 3D gyroscope may be useful for this.

                    <h2>Analysis</h2>
                    <div class="about-content">
                        Primary step activities such as walking, running and jogging have low error rates when assessed individually. However, people perform a large variety of tasks every day, so it is important that the step counter is accurate across several activities. The larger error rates of individual activities such as typing and taking large steps could provide the user a very inaccurate step count. The mean percent error across all seven activities performed was 30.524%. This is twice as large as the industry standard of 15%. This could make a significant difference for someone counting their steps such as to measure health and fitness. A person who spends the majority of their day at a desk with the goal to average 10,000 steps a day could be misled with a count inaccuracy as large as 3,052 steps. This is largely dependent on which activities a person performs on a day to day basis which will vary greatly from person to person. For this reason it would be important to improve on this algorithm to compare to the industry standard.

                        Our algorithm struggled with determining the difference between actual steps and other small movements with peaks, this was most noticeable with the typing task. The algorithm currently cannot distinguish wrist movement from walking movements and interprets the acceleration from wrist movement, as if the user was moving even if they were not. Another improvement that could be made to our algorithm is a step frequency check. We attempted to prevent too many steps from being counted if they were in close proximity to each other in order to reduce false positives. This would be especially useful in the typing task given that our algorithm detected a large number of “steps” in such a short amount of time. Improving this frequency threshold would yield more accurate results.
