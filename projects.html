                                This project demonstrated well rounded knowledge of the data science pipeline. The aim was to select and analyze a dataset to identify meaningful problems and motivations. The identified moitvations would then be studied through exploratory data analysis, supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. The Energy dataset from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/energy">Our World in Data</a> was selected for this project, from which we aimed to identify countries of similar fuel usage and factors that impact fuel usage.

                            This project aims to investigate the effects of radiation therapy on both tumor and normal tissue. Radiation therapy utilizes ionizing radiation to damage the DNA of cancerous tissue and induce cell death, inevitably damaging normal tissue in this process. Fractionation is the process of dividing radiation dose and administering it over an extended period to minimize the death of healthy tissue. The first objective for the project was to design a simulation of cell survival using Monte Carlo methods. The simulation was developed using Microsoft Excel and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), based on a Linear-Quadratic (LQ) Model, which predicts the probability of cell survival based on the radiation dose in gray (Gy).

                            <br>
                            Once created, the model was used to explore fractionation schemes. In conventional fractionation 1.8 - 2.2Gy  is administered per fraction. Multiple fractionation schemes will be modeled and compared to others in order to determine consequences on tumor and normal tissue, and determine which is the best to use. Lastly, the simulation will be used to investigate dose localization and hypofractionation. This will then be compared to conventional fractionation.
